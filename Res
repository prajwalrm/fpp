Hi Lakshmi/ Kanthi,


I am writing to formally resign from my position as Software Engineer 1A at Bank of America Continuum, with today marking the beginning of my two-month notice period. While my official last working day would be June 4, 2025, I would like to kindly request, if possible, to be relieved by the end of May or earlier.

This decision comes after careful consideration, as my time at the organization has been both rewarding and instrumental in shaping my professional journey. I would like to express my sincere gratitude for the opportunities Iâ€™ve had to grow, take on new responsibilities, and progress in my career within such a short span. Your trust and support have meant a great deal to me.

It has been a privilege to be part of such a dedicated and talented team. I have learned a great deal, and the experience gained here will continue to guide me in the future.

Over the next two months, I am fully committed to ensuring a smooth transition and will do my utmost to support the team during this period.

Thank you once again for everything. I wish you and the team continued success.
